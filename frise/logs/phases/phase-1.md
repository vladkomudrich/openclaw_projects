# Phase 1: Core Sleep Calculations

## Completed: 2026-02-06T11:48:00Z

## Tasks Completed
- [x] task-1.1: Define TypeScript interfaces
- [x] task-1.2: Implement Two-Process Model calculations
- [x] task-1.3: Create productivity curve generator
- [x] task-1.4: Create supporting calculation functions
- [x] task-1.5: Create localStorage service

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Two-Process Model calculations accurate
- [x] All calculation functions implemented
- [x] localStorage service works correctly
- [x] TypeScript types defined for all data models

## Summary
Implemented complete sleep science calculations based on Borbély's Two-Process Model. Created productivity curve generator with 5-minute granularity. Built localStorage service with 14-day rolling window and full CRUD operations.

## Key Calculations
1. Process S (Sleep Homeostasis) - exponential buildup/decay
2. Process C (Circadian Rhythm) - 24-hour sinusoidal + 12-hour harmonic
3. Combined productivity formula - weighted combination
4. Melatonin window - 2 hours before ideal bedtime
5. Sleep debt - cumulative over tracking period
