# Content Creation Framework for Vlad

## 🎯 Your Workflow

**Step 1:** Share your raw thoughts (text/audio) in Notion "Raw Input" field
**Step 2:** I turn it into a structured script following your rules
**Step 3:** You record using the visual guidance
**Step 4:** Edit in CapCut using the provided templates/notes

## 📝 Script Structure (60s TikTok/Reels)

### HOOK (0-3 seconds)
- Strong opening statement
- Controversial or surprising fact
- Direct question to viewer

### PROBLEM/CONTEXT (3-15 seconds)  
- What problem are you solving?
- Why should they care?
- Personal experience or data

### SOLUTION/VALUE (15-45 seconds)
- Your specific strategy/approach
- Actionable steps or examples
- Personal results or proof

### CTA (45-60 seconds)
- Clear next action for viewer
- Engagement request (comment, follow, try something)

## 🎨 Visual Templates

### Template 1: Picture-in-Picture (PiP)
- **Use for:** Screen recordings, coding tutorials
- **Setup:** You in small circle, main content full screen
- **CapCut:** Use "PiP" mode, resize to 25% in corner

### Template 2: Split Screen
- **Use for:** Before/after comparisons, dual concepts  
- **Setup:** 50/50 split or 70/30
- **CapCut:** Use "Split" template, adjust ratio

### Template 3: B-roll + Voiceover
- **Use for:** Concept explanations, storytelling
- **Setup:** Stock footage/generated video with your voice
- **CapCut:** Layer audio over visuals, use "Auto Captions"

### Template 4: Screen Recording Focus
- **Use for:** Tool demos, coding walkthroughs
- **Setup:** Full screen recording with occasional face cuts
- **CapCut:** Use "Zoom" effects on important parts

## 🚀 Your Writing Rules Applied

### ✅ Simple English (A2/B1)
- Short sentences (max 10-12 words)
- Common words only
- Easy pronunciation for non-native speakers

### ✅ Human Vibe Phrases
- "What I personally like about this..."
- "Here is my strategy for..."
- "I honestly think..."
- "This is how I do it..."
- "My approach is different..."

### ✅ No Marketing Fluff
- Replace "game-changer" → "saved me 2 hours daily"
- Replace "revolutionary" → "works better than X"
- Replace "amazing" → specific benefit

### ✅ Dense Value
- Every sentence = fact, number, feature, or opinion
- Remove: "So", "Well", "Actually", "Basically"
- Keep: Specific examples, personal experience

## 📝 Content Preferences (Learned from Edits)

### Problem Section
- Focus on time waste: "wastes half of working time" vs "wastes 2 hours daily"
- Be more relatable and impactful

### Tips Structure
- **Explain the WHY**: Not just what to do, but why it works
- **Add specific details**: e.g., "/feature-pipeline starts multiple phases with well-description"
- **Connect to audience**: Mention GitHub for pre-built skills, especially for non-developers
- **Include shocking stats**: "99% of vibe coders do not know about this"
- **Bridge to your content**: Reference Telegram channel for resources

### CTA Strategy
- **Offer multiple options** to choose from based on video goals:
  - **Option A**: Drive to Telegram/external resource
  - **Option B**: Standard follow + engagement
  - **Option C**: Action-based (try specific tip)
- Match text overlay to CTA type

## 📱 CapCut Speed Tips

### Quick Templates
1. **"Coding PiP"** - You in corner + screen recording
2. **"Hook Split"** - Talking head + text overlay
3. **"Demo Flow"** - Screen recording + zoom effects

### Faster Editing
- Use "Auto Captions" for all videos
- Create 3-4 text overlay styles and save them
- Pre-made intro/outro (2-3 seconds each)
- Batch similar videos in one session

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Space = Play/Pause
- S = Split clip
- Delete = Remove selected
- Ctrl+Z = Undo

## 🎬 Example Script (60s)

**Topic:** "Why I code without planning"

**HOOK (0-3s):**
"I never plan my code. Here is why you should not either."
*[Visual: Me in corner, messy code on screen]*

**PROBLEM (3-15s):**
"Most developers waste 2 hours planning. I personally think this kills creativity. You get stuck in your head."
*[Visual: Split screen - me + empty planning docs]*

**SOLUTION (15-45s):**
"Here is my strategy. I open VS Code. I write one function. I test it. Then I write the next one. This is how I built 3 profitable apps in 6 months."
*[Visual: Fast screen recording, me in small circle]*

**CTA (45-60s):**
"Try this tomorrow. Pick a simple feature. No planning. Just code. Comment what you built."
*[Visual: Back to talking head]*
*[Text overlay: "Planning = Procrastination"]*
